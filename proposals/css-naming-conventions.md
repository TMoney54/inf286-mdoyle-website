# Css Naming Conventions

Because of the diffence of the naming conventions I suggest using [BEM](http://getbem.com/) with explanations for its use further displayed in [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-block-element-modifiers-bem-9df46d29b64c)

## What is BEM?

BEM or Block Element Modifier is a naming convention that allows and simplifies the creation of reusable components.

This means that BEM is a system of methods that helps you write your HTML and CSS code so that it is simple to reuse and share with other parts of your code.

## How does the BEM work?

BEM is split into 3 parts - **BLOCK**, **ELEMENT** and **MODIFIER**.

## Blocks

Blocks are standalone entities that are reusable. Examples include `header`, `card`, `form` etc.

```css
.header {
}
.card {
}
.form {
}
```
